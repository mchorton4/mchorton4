# Malia Horton

I am a UX researcher, graphic designer, who is open to new opportunities.
I grew up mostly in Spokane, WA. Graduated from West Valley High School in 2018. With many summers spent in Ketchikan, Ak. My time spent between two different homes made me look at the world from different perspectives. My upbringing taught me that with respect, hard work and focus will bring you success. 
I am currently finishing studying graphic design at Eastern Washington University, where I am earning a bachelor's in visual communications design, a minor in Communications and a certificate in User Experience.
